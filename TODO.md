# TODO: Add Multiple Location Readings for Fake GPS Detection

## Tasks
- [x] Modify presensi.blade.php JavaScript to collect 3 location readings every 5 seconds when page loads
- [x] Update UI to show progress of location readings with countdown timer
- [x] Disable presensi button until all readings are complete
- [x] Store all readings in sessionStorage
- [x] On button click, send all readings to backend without new fetch
- [x] Update backend fake GPS detection: if ALL 4 readings have identical latitude and longitude (not 3)
- [x] Add detailed problem descriptions in fake location detection with coordinate details
- [x] Removed skip fake GPS detection for presensi outside working hours - now only detects identical coordinates
- [x] Update fake location menu to display coordinate details from database analysis
- [ ] Test presensi functionality with multiple readings

## Status
- Frontend implementation completed: Multiple readings (3 on load + 1 on click) with progress UI
- Backend fake GPS detection updated: detects ONLY if ALL 4 readings have identical coordinates (not 3)
- Removed time-based filtering - now strictly detects only identical coordinate patterns
- Updated fake location menu to show detailed coordinate information from database
- Ready for testing
