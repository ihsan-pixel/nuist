## Notes
- The existing JadwalMengajar model and controller are separate and not modified.
- New table is `teaching_schedules` instead of updating the existing `jadwal_mengajar`.
- Access control is handled in the controller methods.
- Views use Bootstrap classes for styling.
- Kelengkapan Data Madrasah shows completeness percentage based on 9 criteria (8 fields + tenaga pendidik existence).
