# Teaching Schedule Menu Implementation

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Created migration for `teaching_schedules` table with fields: school_id, teacher_id, day (enum), subject, class_name, start_time, end_time, created_by
- [x] Created TeachingSchedule model with relations to User (teacher, creator) and Madrasah (school)
- [x] Created TeachingScheduleController with CRUD methods, role-based access, and overlap validation
- [x] Added resource routes for teaching-schedules with role middleware
- [x] Created Blade views:
  - index.blade.php: Admin view with tables grouped by teacher
  - teacher-index.blade.php: Teacher view with schedules per day
  - create.blade.php: Form to add schedule
  - edit.blade.php: Form to edit schedule
- [x] Added menu item to sidebar for Jadwal Mengajar
- [x] Implemented role-based access:
  - Super Admin: All schedules
  - Admin: Only their school's schedules
  - Tenaga Pendidik: Only their own schedules

## Next Steps
- [ ] Run `php artisan migrate` to create the table (ensure database is connected)
- [ ] Test the functionality by logging in as different roles
- [ ] Verify overlap validation works correctly
- [ ] Check that forms validate inputs properly

## Notes
- The existing JadwalMengajar model and controller are separate and not modified.
- New table is `teaching_schedules` instead of updating the existing `jadwal_mengajar`.
- Access control is handled in the controller methods.
- Views use Bootstrap classes for styling.
