git add .\g# Dashboard Super Admin Improvement Plan

## Information Gathered
- Current dashboard has basic card layout for super admin statistics
- Shows total madrasah, teachers, admins, super admins, pengurus, school principals
- Has employment status breakdown and detailed statistics table
- Layout is functional but lacks visual appeal and modern design elements

4. **Color Scheme**: Use consistent color scheme with better contrast and visual hierarchy
5. **Typography**: Improve text hierarchy and readability
6. **Interactive Elements**: Add hover effects and better visual feedback

## Dependent Files to Edit
