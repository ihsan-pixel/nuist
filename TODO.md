# TODO: Add Multiple Location Readings for Fake GPS Detection

## Tasks
- [x] Modify presensi.blade.php JavaScript to collect 3 location readings every 5 seconds when page loads
- [x] Update UI to show progress of location readings with countdown timer
- [x] Disable presensi button until all readings are complete
- [x] Store all readings in sessionStorage
- [x] On button click, send all readings to backend without new fetch

- [x] Add detailed problem descriptions in fake location detection with coordinate details
- [x] Skip fake GPS detection for presensi outside working hours
- [ ] Test presensi functionality with multiple readings

## Status
- Frontend implementation completed: Multiple readings (3 on load + 1 on click) with progress UI
