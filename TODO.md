# TODO: Update Teaching Schedule Carousel on Mobile Dashboard

## Task Overview
Update the teaching schedule section on the mobile dashboard to display a horizontal card carousel where each card takes 1/3 of the mobile display width. Allow multiple schedules to be visible and scrollable without disappearing animations. Remove the indicators.

## Steps to Complete
- [ ] Modify the HTML structure of the schedule section to use a custom horizontal scrollable container instead of Bootstrap carousel
- [ ] Update CSS styles for the schedule carousel to enable horizontal scrolling with cards at 1/3 width
- [ ] Remove carousel indicators and controls from the HTML
- [ ] Ensure the layout is responsive and works on mobile devices
- [ ] Test the changes to verify multiple cards are visible and scrollable
