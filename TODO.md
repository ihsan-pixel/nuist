# Dashboard Enhancement - School Principal Display

## Completed Tasks âœ…

### 1. Backend Changes
- **Modified DashboardController** (`app/Http/Controllers/DashboardController.php`):
  - Added `$schoolPrincipal` variable initialization
  - Created `getSchoolPrincipal()` method to fetch principal data based on `ketugasan = 'kepala madrasah/sekolah'`
  - Updated view data to include `$schoolPrincipal` for both admin role scenarios

### 2. Frontend Changes
- **Updated Dashboard View** (`resources/views/dashboard/index.blade.php`):
  - Added middle card between "Total Tenaga Pendidik" and "Madrasah Saat Ini"
  - Changed column layout from 2 columns (col-md-6) to 3 columns (col-md-4 each)
  - Added School Principal card with:
    - Warning-colored icon (mdi-account-tie)
    - Dynamic display of principal's name
    - Fallback to "-" when no principal is assigned
    - "Kepala Sekolah" label

### 3. Features Implemented
- **School Principal Display**: Shows the name of the school principal in the middle card
- **Responsive Design**: Three equal-width cards that work well on different screen sizes
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles cases where no principal is assigned
- **Consistent Styling**: Matches the existing card design patterns

## Database Requirements
The feature relies on the existing `ketugasan` field in the users table. To assign a school principal:
- Set a user's `ketugasan` field to `'kepala madrasah/sekolah'`
- Ensure the user belongs to the same madrasah as the admin user

## Testing Recommendations
1. **Test with Principal**: Verify the principal's name displays correctly in the middle card
2. **Test without Principal**: Verify the card shows "-" when no principal is assigned
3. **Test Responsiveness**: Check the layout on different screen sizes
4. **Test Permissions**: Ensure only admin users can see the statistics section

## Files Modified
- `app/Http/Controllers/DashboardController.php` - Added principal fetching logic
- `resources/views/dashboard/index.blade.php` - Added middle card for principal display

The implementation is complete and ready for testing! ðŸŽ‰
