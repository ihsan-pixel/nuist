Steps to debug the issue where teacher names do not load after clicking "Cari Nama Guru":

1. Verify AJAX URL:
   - Open browser developer tools (F12).
   - Go to Network tab.
   - Click "Cari Nama Guru" button.
   - Check if a request is sent to the URL like /teaching-schedules/get-teachers/{schoolId}.
   - Confirm the request URL is correct and the response status is 200.

2. Check AJAX Response:
   - In the Network tab, select the AJAX request.
   - Inspect the response body.
   - Confirm it contains a JSON array of teachers with id and name fields.

3. Check Console for Errors:
   - Go to Console tab in developer tools.
   - Look for any JavaScript errors or warnings when clicking the button.

4. Verify Server Logs:
   - Check Laravel logs (storage/logs/laravel.log) for any errors or the debug log entry from getTeachersBySchool method.
   - Confirm the method is called and returns data.

5. Test Endpoint Directly:
   - Access the URL /teaching-schedules/get-teachers/{schoolId} directly in browser or via curl/postman.
   - Confirm it returns the expected JSON data.

6. Verify Blade Template:
   - Confirm the button with id "loadTeachersBtn" exists.
   - Confirm the JavaScript event listener is correctly attached and not overridden.

7. Check CSRF Token:
   - Ensure AJAX requests include CSRF token if required by Laravel.
